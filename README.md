## 	ACTIVITIES AND COURSE OBJECTIVES
### A.	Stand-up Meetings
The stand-up meetings conducted weekly during the process of developing this project played a crucial role in fulfilling task objectives related to teamwork and system performance assessment. These meetings provided an opportunity to collaborate effectively, communicate thoroughly, collect progress updates, and synthesis our efforts towards project milestones. By participating in these meetings, team members learned how to work with on another, address challenges, take criticism of code, and analyze the performance of our web application in real-time. This regular engagement enabled us to adapt our strategies, allocate resources, and maintain a cohesive approach to software development.  
### B.	Training on Ethics
As part of our senior project, each team member
completed an individual training session on ethical considerations in software engineering. This activity directly addressed course objectives related to testing system performance and completing substantial project work with ethical awareness. The training session, totaling forty-five minutes per student, enhanced our understanding of ethical dilemmas and decision-making processes within the context of software design and development. This experience contributed to our ability to assess diverse perspectives on ethical issues, ensuring our project work aligned with ethical standards and considerations. 
### C.	Ten Test Cases 
#### 1)	User Authentication and Access Control 
The User Authentication and Access Control test case aims to validate the functionality and security of user authentication and access control mechanisms within the Habilis web application. This test involves registering a new user account with valid credentials and attempting login with incorrect credentials to verify appropriate error handling. Additionally, the test ensures that user roles (such as subject area experts and administrators) are correctly assigned and restricts access based on role permissions. By conducting this test, we can assess the effectiveness and reliability of the application's authentication and access control features.
#### 2)	Data Labeling Accuracy and Validation 
The Data Labeling Accuracy and Validation test case is designed to verify the accuracy and reliability of data labeling using machine learning algorithms in the Habilis web application. This test involves inputting sample data for labeling, running the machine learning algorithm, and validating the accuracy of labeled data against expert-verified results. Furthermore, the test evaluates the consistency and quality of labeled data metrics output. By executing this test, we can ensure that the data labeling process meets the desired standards of accuracy and reliability.
#### 3)	Security and Encryption 
The Security and Encryption test case assesses the implementation of security measures, including data encryption and secure communication, within the Habilis web application. This test involves attempting to access sensitive data without proper authentication, verifying data encryption in the database, and ensuring that communication between the client and server is encrypted using HTTPS. By conducting this test, we can validate the effectiveness of the application's security features and ensure the protection of sensitive information.
#### 4)	Scalability and Performance Testing
The Scalability and Performance Testing test case evaluates the scalability and performance of the backend architecture under load within the Habilis web application. This test involves simulating increased data volume and user traffic to measure response times and resource utilization. Additionally, the test assesses the system's behavior under varying load conditions, such as concurrent user interactions. By executing this test, we can identify potential scalability issues and ensure optimal performance of the application under realistic usage scenarios.
#### 5)	Cross-Browser Compatibility and Accessibility 
The Cross-Browser Compatibility and Accessibility test case ensures consistent functionality and accessibility across different web browsers in the Habilis web application. This test involves accessing the application using various browsers (such as Chrome, Firefox, and Safari) to verify that color layouts are adjusted for higher contrast and adhere to WCAG and 508 Compliance standards. Furthermore, the test evaluates usability for users with visual disabilities, ensuring an inclusive user experience across all supported browsers.
#### 6)	Error Handling and Recovery
The Error Handling and Recovery test case validates the system's ability to handle and recover from errors gracefully within the Habilis web application. This test involves introducing simulated errors, such as invalid input or server downtime, to verify error messages and ensure proper error recovery mechanisms. By conducting this test, we can assess the application's robustness and reliability in handling unexpected scenarios, enhancing overall user experience and system resilience.
#### 7)	Authentication & Authorization Role-Based Access Control 
The Authentication and Authorization Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) test case confirms the implementation of robust authentication and authorization mechanisms in the Habilis web application. This test involves testing different user roles (such as subject area experts and administrators) to verify that users can only access features and data relevant to their role. Additionally, the test ensures that unauthorized access attempts are denied, enhancing the application's security and data protection capabilities.
#### 8)	Integration of Flask with Angular Frontend 
The Integration of Flask with Angular Frontend test case validates the seamless integration between the Angular frontend and Flask backend for machine learning script execution within the Habilis web application. This test involves triggering machine learning scripts through the web application interface, verifying communication and data flow between frontend and backend components. By executing this test, we can ensure the effective integration of technology stacks and functionalities, enabling advanced data processing capabilities and user interactions.
#### 9)	Database Management and Data Integrity
The Database Management and Data Integrity test case evaluates the functionality and performance of MongoDB database management within the Habilis web application. This test involves populating data tables with user and project-related information, testing dynamic data retrieval, and verifying data integrity and consistency during data access and manipulation. By conducting this test, we can ensure the reliability and efficiency of database operations, supporting seamless application functionality and user experience.
#### 10) Code Reusability and Maintainability
The Code Reusability and Maintainability test case assesses the maintainability and efficiency of code organization within the Habilis web application. This test involves reviewing the codebase for modular organization and reusable components, testing modifications and extensions to ensure code clarity and readability.
